# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to find patterns, relationships, and anomalies.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading & basic statistics (`.info()`, `.describe()`)
2. Univariate analysis (distributions, histograms, countplots)
3. Bivariate analysis (boxplots, survival by class/gender)
4. Correlation analysis (heatmap, pairplot)
5. Observations written for each visualization
6. Summary of findings exported as PDF

## Deliverables
- `EDA_Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code & plots
- `EDA_Report.pdf`: Report of findings
- `train.csv`: Dataset
- `README.md`: Documentation

## Learning Outcome
- Learned to analyze dataset distributions
- Identified relationships & correlations
- Practiced visual storytelling using Python libraries
